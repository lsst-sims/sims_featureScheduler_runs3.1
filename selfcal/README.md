Looking at how well selfcal can run in different scenarios

Parameters we want to run over

* 1 and 2 years
* rolling, non-rolling, other footprints (~5 total)
* filter (6)

so, that comes out to 60 simulations. 

Output for each:
* solved stars array
* rms and IQR for wfd area
* I guess a plot or two, maybe?

One big remaining question will be if the results hold for smaller patches and more stars. I suppose we could run a 2x2  (and 3x3) patch sim and see if anything radically changes.
